The idea I'd like to convey is, essentially, that we're all going to die soon. That's right, all of us. There aren't that many years left, and nothing is guaranteed. I think we spend too much time ignoring and not enough time worrying about this. I recommend a healthy amount of worrying about your impending death, because many people live as though they were going to live forever, and you're simply not going to. You are going to die soon, even if that's 60 years from now, because that's really soon, and I want to illustrate that visually to encourage myself and other people to go do something with their life, and invest themselves more fully into what they're doing right now. There will be a last time you will get to do anything that you do, and knowing that should invest each thing you do with a certain intense meaning. I know that's not sustainable, but meditating on death is something I recommend for most relatively stable people. I've seen images before that represent this visually really well by showing you how many more times you get to do x *if you're lucky.* It can be really stunning how many more books you might read. Even if you're an avid reader, you might only read enough books to stack about as tall as you for *the rest of your life.* I'm going to find a creative thing to use to illustrate that, maybe books, maybe something else.
